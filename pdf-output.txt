ISTP: Interactive Socio-Technical Practicum is a 4-credit 6th Semester practicum course  that involves development of useful products and technologies that require an  understanding of the socio-economic context in which they will be used.  MTP (MTP-1 + MTP-2): Major Technical Project (BTech final year project) is a 3 (MTP-1) + 5  (MTP-2) credit course where students work on projects of their interest under the  supervision of a faculty. This project could be outside the field of your discipline.  Course code for MTP-1 is DP-498P; DP will be replaced by your respective program. For eg  CS-498P, DS-498P, EE-498P and so on.  ISTP :   Ô£ö  MTP :   Ô£ö  ISTP :   Ô£û  MTP :   Ô£ö  ISTP :   Ô£ö  MTP :   Ô£û  ISTP :   Ô£û  MTP :   Ô£û  ISTP :   Ô£ö  MTP -1:   Ô£ö  MTP-2:   Ô£û  DE   x   x   x + 8   x + 8   x + 5  FE   y   y + 4   y   y + 4   y  ISTP & MTP
MTP If a student opts to do MTP, but obtain grade point 6 or below in MTP-1 (XX498P), he/she will not be  allowed to continue on to the second stage of MTP-2 (XX499P). The grade earned by the student in  MTP-1 (XX498P) will be included in the grade sheet and transcript. The student will have to make up  for the remaining MTP credits by taking 5 credits from the Discipline Electives basket in next  semester.  However, if such a student wishes to continue doing the MTP, he/she may appeal giving justification  to the Dean (Academics) with the recommendation of the MTP guide(s) and Faculty Advisor.  If a student has earned a grade point of 7 (ÔÇÖB-ÔÇÖ grade) or above in MTP-1 (XX498P), they will be  required to continue on to MTP-2 (XX499P).  However, if such a student wishes not to pursue MTP-2 (XX499P), he/she may appeal to Dean  (Academics) through the Faculty Advisor and the guide(s), with strong justification from both  student and guide(s). Since huge efforts are put by the guide also(s) in MTP, dropping MTP-2  (XX499P) is highly discouraged and rarely permission will be given for dropping MTP-2.  If allowed to drop MTP-2 (XX499P), the grade earned by the student in MTP-1 (XX498P) will be  included in the grade sheet and transcript. Then the student will have to make up for the remaining  MTP credits by taking 5 credits from the Discipline Electives basket.  If a student opts   to do MTP completely in a different discipline, they would be awarded 8 credits  from Free Elective basket.
Research Projects  Undergraduate Research Project:  B.S. Students are highly encouraged to opt for undergraduate research projects aligned with  their specific research and scientific interest in their 7th and 8th semesters.  This research-based learning provides a great opportunity for the students to learn research  methodology and instrumentation, which can be aligned to the stream specialization or minors.  The research-based learning is optional, and if not opted for, the credit requirements need to be  fulfilled through discipline elective courses.  Post-Graduate Project (PGP):  This must be done by the students who opt for the B. Tech - M. Tech or B.S. - M.S. program. The  project will be a single project spanned over the 9th and 10th semesters or last two semesters.  Each student will be assigned to a supervisor(s) at IIT Mandi to pursue the project. An external  co-supervisor can be opted for as per the InstituteÔÇÖs Senate approved norms.  After completion of the project, students need to submit a detailed project report.  All courses, other than Discipline core in a parent branch will be by default discipline electives. For  outside discipline courses, a separ ate lis t is available in the respective curriculum.  Any discipline elective course, beyond the minimum limit may also be counted as free elective.
HSS & IKS  12 credits can be completed by taking any HSS course  HSS courses cover various domains such as -  Sociology  Economics  Literature  Entrepreneurship  A maximum of 20 HSS credits can count towards the 160 credits required  for the BTech degree  This doesnÔÇÖt mean you canÔÇÖt do more than 20 HSS credits! You are free to  do more than 20 credits that will count outside the 160 credits requirement  One course on Indian Knowledge System (worth 3 credits) is compulsory for  everyone.
Discipline Courses - B.Tech  1.   Discipline Core  These are compulsory courses related to your major degree  The number of credits may vary depending on your branch  These courses start from your 3rd semester  There could be some overlap among branches  2. Discipline Electives  These are courses related to your major degree, but you would have a choice  among a pool of elective courses  The number of credits again vary depending on your branch  Detailed Curriculum Folder:   Link

Free Electives  Any course which you can take in the institute can be counted towards your FE  Not just a complete course, but the partial remains of overflowing credits from  some other baskets can also count towards FE, making   FE like a SINK  Example 1: LetÔÇÖs say you took both IC240 - Mechanics of Rigid Bodies and  CS202 - Data Structures and Algorithms from IC - II basket. One course  would count towards IC requirements (the compulsory one) and the other  would count under FE.  Example 2: If you wish to do more than 12 credits under HSS, the remaining  credits would count under FE (till it isnÔÇÖt 20).  Example 3: If you wish to do more DE courses than the specified limit of your  branch, again, the extra credits would count under FE.  Example 4: If you do an internship that is longer than the minimum  requirement of 6 weeks, then the extra credits go to FE.  Example 5: If you tried to count up some courses for Minor, they go to FE.
Pass/Fail Courses   Audit Courses  Grades are Pass (P) or Fail (F)   Grades are Audit Pass (AP) or Audit Fail (AF)  The grades are binary in both of them. These wonÔÇÖt affect your CGPA.  P/F Courses count towards the B.Tech requirement &  contribute to the Free Electives Basket.  Audit Courses do not count towards B.Tech  requirements.  A maximum of 9 P/F credits can be taken and not more than 6  in a given semester (excl. SemLong Intern)   No limit on taking Audit courses in B. Tech  P/F credits can be used for -  a.   Semester Internship  b.   Self Study Courses (via NPTEL, SWAYAM)  c.   Research work/project under a professor of IIT  Mandi, in Industry or Academia  Audit courses are useful to include any  workshops, conferences, etc that you have  attended, on your BTech transcript  Courses offered at IIT Mandi:  Must declare the course as P/F at the beginning of the  semester.  ÔÇÿPÔÇÖ grade will be awarded if student obtains the  minimum passing grade ÔÇÿDÔÇÖ  Students will have the option to Add/Drop an audit  course upto 2 weeks after the normal Add/Drop date  for the semester
NOTE  The credit limit for a semester ranges from a minimum of 12  credits to 22 credits.  However, AD Courses can increase the credit limit to 25 credits  in order to meet up with the degree requirements.  If a student goes for a vacation semester or a semester long  internship, then the minimum credit limit for the semester can  be relaxed to 9 credits.  If you want to take more than 25 credits, then you may take  permission from AD Courses before the add/drop period.  Course List for Even Semester 2026:   Link   (Educational Access)
IIT Mandi has signed various MoUs with national and international institutes.  UG students can visit these institutes in their 5th - 7th semesters (at most 2 contiguous semesters).  Shortlisting is solely done on the basis of your CGPA at the time of application.  Students will not have to pay any fees to the host institute, but any cost for travel, stay (hostel), food,  etc must be borne by students.  Scholarships may be provided to some students by some host institutes.  Students usually prefer going to a Semester Exchange because of the following:  Exploring/pursuing courses not offered at IIT Mandi that interest you  Learning about the culture of a new country  Traveling & tourism  Colleges with an active MoU with IIT Mandi as of DecemberÔÇÖ25   Universit├â┬® de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour  (UPPA), France  TU Munich   TU Dresden   TU Darmstadt   TU Braunschweig  Kyushu University, Japan   National University  Corporation, Japan  Chung Yuan Christian  University (CYCU), Taiwan  Missouri University of Science and  Technology, US  University of Agder, Norway   Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology, Germany   RWTH Aachen, Germany   Leibniz University, Hannover  Semester Exchange

Semester Exchange  For TU9 & European Colleges  The Senate approved the proposal for  the management of attendance for students going  for the International Semester Exchange Program.  The students are permitted to register for ongoing  semester's courses, however, their attendance will count  from the day they report to the institute. They need to  fulfil the attendance criterion specified by the institute  once they join the campus in person.  The students may be provided with the video recordings  of the classes (if available/made available), link for online  classes, or equivalent courses on NPTEL/SWAYAM etc.  The student(s) may work with the instructor and FA to  identify the online courses, if available. Students will be  attending the lectures / watching the lectures online till  they are back on campus.  The mid sem exams for those students need to be  conducted during the makeup slots. They have to attend  the end semester exam, as per the regular schedule.

The committee notified/authorized by the  Senate confirms the equivalence of  courses taken during the semester  exchange.  Since the students miss significant portion  of the course before physically joining the  course, instructors may impose 100%  attendance, excluding medical absence
Internships (2 Month)  It is compulsory for all students to do an internship of at least 6 weeks duration in or outside  India.  It is worth 2 credits and to be done after your 5th semester. This will count as P/F for IC-010  under Semester-8 credits   & also towards the credit limits of the semester.  Internships are usually of 3 types -  Industrial - Internships that offer industrial experience  Research - Internships that are research-oriented, in industry or academia  Academic - Internships under professors of other institutes  On-campus internships are usually industrial internships, whereas students look for  opportunities off-campus for research and academic internships in prestigious institutes.  This internship needs to be completed before the commencement of the final semester.  You need not register for this course exclusively.  The two credits for the mandatory industrial internship are only given at the sole judgment  of the respective faculty advisor. Students are advised to get their faculty advisor's consent  before applying for internships. This is particularly important for general/non-core  company.
Similar to a 2 month internship, you can do this internship in the industry or  academia inside or outside India  A semester   internship gives more extended exposure and is quite useful for your  career growth  A minimum credit limit requirement of 105 credits by the end of 5   semester might  be imposed by some FAÔÇÖs if your on-site internship is in 6   semester just to ensure  you meet up the degree requirements. There is no restriction on the minimum  credit requirements before going to a semester-long internship by CnPC.  th  th  There are also opportunities to do an semester internship in programmes like  MITACS  Semester Internship could be of 2 types  Semester Long Onsite Internships  Semester Long Remote Internships  Projects under IIT Mandi Faculties cannot count toward internships credits.  Semester Long Internship
Semester Long Remote Internships  This option allows the student to stay at IIT Mandi and opt for certain courses  along with managing the internship  Semester long remote internships are worth 6 P/F FE credits & could be done  in your 6th, 7th or 8th semesters. It should be of a minimum 14 weeks.  Students can do a maximum of 9 credits worth courses along with 6 credits of  online internship  You have to register for the course DP-396P, where DP is replaced by branch  specific codes, for eg. CS-396P, DS-396P, EE-396P and so on.  (Most of the 6 month internships are of 20 weeks, so you get 2 credits of  IC-010 & 6 P/F FE credits of DP-396P).  You need to obtain approval from your Faculty Advisor (FA), after which you  must request a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Academic Section.  The NOC should be obtained before the add/drop deadline of the semester in  which you are undertaking the internship.
Semester Long Onsite Internships  Semester long onsite internships are worth 9 P/F FE credits.  This could be done in your 6th or 7th semesters. For 8th semester onsite  internships, special approval of Dean Academics is required.  It should be of minimum 14 weeks  Students are not permitted to do any offline/online courses during the onsite  internship period.  You have to register for the course DP-399P, where DP is replaced by branch  specific codes, for eg. CS-399P, DS-399P, EE-399P and so on.  (Most of the 6 month internships are of 20 weeks, so you get 2 credits of  IC-010 & 9 P/F FE credits of DP-399P).  You need to obtain approval from your Faculty Advisor (FA), after which you  must request a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Academic Section.
