## Which Option Should You Choose?

### Choose ISTP in Semester 6 If:
- ✅ You want to spread workload evenly across final 3 semesters
- ✅ You want semester 8 to be lighter (only MTP-2)
- ✅ You're interested in societal impact projects early
- ✅ You want to complete ISTP before final year rush

### Choose ISTP in Semester 8 If:
- ✅ You want to fully focus on core curriculum in sem 6
- ✅ You're still deciding about ISTP in semester 6
- ✅ You want both projects (MTP + ISTP) together in final semester
- ⚠️ Be aware: Semester 8 becomes VERY heavy (9+ credits)

### Skip ISTP If:
- ✅ You want lighter final year workload
- ✅ You're not interested in socio-technical projects
- ✅ You prefer to use those 4 credits for Free Electives
- ✅ You want to focus purely on MTP (8 credits only)

## Important Clarifications

### ISTP is NOT MTP
- MTP: Required, technical project, 8 credits (3+5)
- ISTP: Optional, socio-technical project, 4 credits

### ISTP Replaces Course Credits, Not MTP
- Choosing ISTP does NOT reduce MTP requirement
- You still do BOTH MTP-1 (3) and MTP-2 (5)
- ISTP is ADDITIONAL 4 credits (or you get +4 FE if skipped)

### Semester 8 Can Be Heavy
- If you choose ISTP in Sem 8: MTP-2 (5) + ISTP (4) + other courses = 9+ credits
- If you skip ISTP: MTP-2 (5) + other courses = 7-8 credits
- Plan accordingly!
